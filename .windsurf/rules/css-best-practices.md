When making styling changes follow the following best practices:
- No in-line styling. The only form of in-line styling is when a styling library has supported props that alter the style. But absolutely no in-line css styling.
- Mobile first responsiveness. Create media queries with a mobile first approach. This means the styles should work for mobile first, then set min-widths for larger screen sizes.
- CSS Variables. Define colors, spacing, and typography as CSS variables. Makes theming and global changes easier
- Use relative units (rem) for sizing. Sometimes px is appropriate when creating a specific style that should not change based on font size. This includes things like background styles.
